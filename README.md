<h2>Welcome</h2>
I have always enjoyed helping others learn.  
One of my favorite subjects is teaching Computer Science concepts.

<h3>Code Samples</h3>
As some of the concepts can be difficult to understand, I will leave a code snippet 
or solution to an issue that was dicussed during a tutoring session.
